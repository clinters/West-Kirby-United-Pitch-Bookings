  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Information is used solely to manage pitch bookings and avoid scheduling conflicts. Data is stored securely in Google Sheets linked to the bot.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share personal data with third parties. Access is limited to administrators of the West Kirby United Pitch Bot.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Booking data is kept for record-keeping during the season and may be cleared annually. Phone numbers remain linked to team IDs until you request removal.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request removal of your data at any time. See our <a href="data-deletion.html">Data Deletion Instructions</a>.</p>
